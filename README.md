# **Mountain America Coding Challenge**
Clone this repo (or download zip) and complete Parts 1 & 2. When you're finished, push your changes up to a public repo we can view or send it to us in a zipped file.

## **Part 1**
Complete the Express API and React App to display a list of animals. Please use hooks instead of component lifecycle methods.

Some placeholder animal data is provided in /server/data.js. (`const data = require('./data');`)

#### **Requirements**:
* Style the background of every other row
* At screen widths 600px and greater: the name and age should be adjacent. At screen widths less than 600px: the name and age should be stacked vertically
* Example list design:
    * <img alt="Example Design" src="./screenshot1.png" width="300px" /> <img alt="Example Design" src="./screenshot2.png" width="300px" />


#### **Extra credit**:
* Style the list further
* Add a text search filter to the list
* Add create, update, and delete functionality

## Coding Standards

I will attempt to use the React coding standards and best practices located ([here](https://www.jondjones.com/frontend/react/react-tutorials/react-coding-standards-and-practices-to-level-up-your-code/))

## Documentation

I will be using doxygen comments to document the code I write. VS Code has a nice extension to generate comment blocks for you like it does in Visual Studio.
